# Machine Learning

This repository contains various machine learning algorithms implemented using Python. It provides examples of how to use popular ML libraries such as NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and others. The project is organized for ease of understanding, experimentation, and extension.

## Project Structure

- `ml-env/`: Python virtual environment for the project
- `data/`: Folder for storing datasets
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks demonstrating machine learning algorithms
- `src/`: Source code for machine learning models and utilities
- `README.md`: Project documentation

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the environment and get started:

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Python 3.11.9** or higher (managed using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv))
